# Decided to apply the Cynefin framework for estimation.
 
Taking what you know of the task or requirement which of the following descriptions would it fit?

**Chaotic** No cause and effect relationships can be determined. Entered deliberately for innovation or accidently with a focus on stabilization. Any practice or solution would be novel.

**Complex** A system without causality, one that's unpredictable. You've just crossed over into… the  unknown unknowns. Is unable to be broken down pieces solveable with rules, systems or processes, because of the unknowns and interrelated factors. Make safe fail experiments, don't do fail safe design.

**Complicated** : Cause and effect isn't self evident. Hard to solve, but solveable with rules, systems or processes. Needs experts or analytical response.

**Simple**: Cause and effect relation exists and is predictable. An ordered system with self evident solutions.

**Disorder** — No ideas on how to approach this. Frustrated, bewildered, and possibily reflecting on past decisions.

points | description | practice | decision model | days of effort
------ | ----------- | -------- | -------------- | --------------
 0 | so **simple** takes longer to log than do the work | best practice | (sense - categorize - respond) | not even worth writing down
 1 | **simple** known task | best practice | (sense - categorize - respond) | <=1/2 day
 2 | **simple** known task | best practice | (sense - categorize - respond) | 1 - 2 days
 3 | **complicated** task or requirement | good practice | (sense - analyse - respond) | ~ 1 weeks 
 5 | **complicated** task or requirement | good practice | (sense - analyse - respond) | ~ 2 weeks
 8 | **complex** task or requirement | emergent practice | (probe - sense - respond) | ~ 3 - 4 weeks
13 | **chaotic** task or requirement | novel practice | (act - sense - respond) | ~ 3 - 4+ weeks
21 | complete **disorder** |  no practice  | (break down - start again for each new part) | Unknown

The points and days of effort are just a starting point.
