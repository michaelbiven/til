# Wardely Maps

Created by Simon Wardley. Can be used to map out needs, values, and evolution of how they interact. It is the **Where**, **Why**, **How**, **What**, and **When**. 

With **Where** and **Why** making up situational awareness. 

And the **How**, **What**, and **When** making up the action.

Creating a wardely maps is a practice of taking a "value chain" and placing it in a graph showing the state of items evolution. 

The value chain are the needs (users, needs, and capabilities arranged and connected according to dependency).

There are four stages of evolution that evolve from left to right: 
Genesis (uncharted) » Custom » Product » Commodity (industrialized)

Genesis can be described as chaotic, uncertain, unpredictable, changing, different, exciting, future worth, or differential to… _x_.

Commodity can be described as ordered, known, measured, stable, standard, dull, low margin, or essential.

Using a wardley map across a whole industry instead of internally can show early adopters and lagards in a market. 

A pattern a Peace to War to Wonder (and repeat) can be seen. Example giving is physcial computers, virtualization, cloud computing, to serverless.
