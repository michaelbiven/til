# Pioneer - Settler - Town Planner structure

Applying this pattern to a wardely map can help identify which people or teams should be working on each item in the value chain.

> When it came to organisation then I used a Pioneer - Settler - Town Planner structure. This is a derivative from Robert Cringley's Accidental Empires, 1993. By derivative, I mean I nicked it or shall we say repurposed a description of companies to running a single company.

> …a variety of skillsets within an organization to address varying activities ranging from research and invention (pioneer); to organization and productization (settler); to industrialization and standardization (town planner).

_pioneers_ people with talents and interests that line up with research, experimentation, finding opportunites, solutions, and problems in chaos. They share out experiments and documents of what they've scouted out.

_settlers_ people with talents and interests that line up with taking experiments and research and turning them into a working product.

_planners_ people with talents and interests that line up with taking those products and scaling them out. Building platforms and turning them into commodities. 

A [serialized version](https://www.cringely.com/2012/02/07/what-the-dickens-accidental-empires-rebooted/) of the book (still in print) can be found on Cringely's site. [Chapter 12: On the Beach](https://www.cringely.com/2013/03/18/accidental-empires-chapter-12-on-the-beach/) covers the parts that inspired Wardley's ideas for pioneers, settlers and town planners.
