# macbook pro touch bar flash white rectangle

Experienced an issue with the touchbar showing a white rectangle at the far right-hand side of the bar. 

These two steps would resolve the issue tempoarily. 

1. ` sudo pkill TouchBarServer`
2. `killall ControlStrip`

Next I tried [resetting the  NVRAM](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063).

Then  I tried [resetting the SMC (System Management Controller)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295).

Netiher fixed the issue and the laptop ended up getting replaced.
